    - Added support for properties and get/set methods on classes that are a
      concrete implementation of a generic class.

      PropertyBackingFieldDrawer.DisplayReorderableListPropertyField() were
      removed and are no longer necessary!
    - No naming assumptions are made for IList backing fields and their
      respective properties anymore!
    - Properties and their respective backing fields need not match type, as
      long as the backing field type is assignable from the property type.

    - Fixed bug calculating property drawer height when property was followed
      by another whose name was prefixed with the preceding property's name.
    - Changed some access modifiers and method signatures of utility methods
      which should generally not be needed anyway.
1.05:
    - Added PropertyBackingFieldDrawer.DisplayArrayPropertyField() and

    - Fixed bug that could cause array setters on prefabs to infinitely invoke.
    - Some accomodations for multi-select.

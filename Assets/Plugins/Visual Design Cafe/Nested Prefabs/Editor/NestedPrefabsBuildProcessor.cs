// The build processor will remove all internal nested prefab components from the project before a build, and restore them again after.
// This increases performance in the build as the internal components have a small overhead. However it will increase build time and requires all prefabs to be reimported.
// Any modifications made to prefabs while in build mode will be discarded when post processing the build.
// It is recommended to only use the processor for a release build.
// For more information visit: https://www.visualdesigncafe.com/products/nestedprefabs/documentation/building.php

// Uncomment the following line to use the automatic build processor.
